# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test


For Server run 

npm run start

Server will start running port 3001

http://localhost/api/message 

GET it will return the message
POST it will send txn to contract for changing the message


NOTE: the server already contains the private key and the deployed contract address for making testing easy.
```
